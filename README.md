This repository contains my learning progress on web scrapping as well as API usage for data retrival. I learnt to use BeautifulSoup, Requests, Urllib, etc. for scrapping data from a webpage. I did some hands on experiment of web scrapping in these notebooks. Besides, I also learnt to use REST APIs for data retrival. It was pretty fun to learn new things! The goal to learn this concepts is to retrive data from websites or web applications in order to generate datasets.
